# React + Vite


- In this project I am using react-vite tool
- I took 3 hours for this project. 9pm to 12pm
- In this project all the ui part in only App.jsx component
- I import data from data.ts file in the App.jsx component
- For run this project you have to use "npm run dev" command


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
